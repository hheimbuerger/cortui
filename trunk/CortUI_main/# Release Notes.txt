\*****************************************************************************/


This is a modification of the user interface of Allegiance
(http://www.freeallegiance.org/). It is based on and inspired by Ksero's
modification
(http://www.freeallegiance.org/oldforums/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=11664).


Changes in CortUI (compared to default UI):
-------------------------------------------
- CortUI comes with an installer that allows you to install or uninstall CortUI
  and/or Slipstream GUI and allows you to customize certain settings.
- Ten lines of chat are shown in the lobby. [optionally, configurable]
- Chat has up to ten lines instead of five. [configurable]
- It also has a scrollbar. [optionally]
- Chat at the loadout screen has an independent number of chat lines from the
  at other screens. [configurable]
- Autopilot and vector-lock status in flight-mode have been moved and the
  graphics have been made smaller to not overlap with the chat.
- Map-mode shows all necessary ship status info in upper left area of the
  screen. (Autopilot and vector-lock status, name of current target, KB of the
  current target, distance to current target, speed of the current target,
  your ship type (and whether you are in the turret of this ship, shield
  status, hull status, energy status, ammo status, fuel status, O2 level,
  current thrust, current speed, current signature, kill bonus.)
- When in base, map-mode shows your ship type and your KB.
- Three additional software HUD modes are available besides the default software
  HUD:
  - the default software HUD with a displayed targeting view
  - a completely revamped software HUD, known as 'Raveen-style'
  - and an even more radical modification, known as 'Parci-style'
- Two additional hardware HUD modes are available besides the default hardware HUD:
  - the default hardware HUD with a displayed targeting view
  - a remodeled HUD that is slimmer and less obscuring.  lessHUD by FlingPu
  - a complete replacement HUD for higher resolutions featuring a centralized
      target view.  JelloShot by FlingPu
- Inventory and minimap have been moved to the side for map-mode, thereby
  making more room for the actual map.
- F3 command-pane has been shrunk so that it won't overlap the inventory
  screen. (This is now probably obsolete, but I haven't removed it yet anyway.)
- Ripcord time is now displayed in map-mode as well, not only in flight-mode.
- Some HUD-controls are shown during launch animation (chat, minimap,
  inventory, etc.).
- The positioning of the windows in hangar and map when in base have been
  moved, so that ten lines of chat are displayed at all times.
- Base status display in hangar-mode has been modified, to not overlap with the
  chat. It is also shown at the map when in base now.
- The 'last orders list' is displayed in the cockpit, in the hangar and on the
  map when in base. [optionally]
- Parts of the hangar graphics have been removed to not overlap with the
  chat. [optionally]
- The drawing order of the windows has been rearranged (e.g. critical info over
  investments, investments over inventory).
- Help button in hangar-mode has been removed because it overlapped with the
  chat and isn't helpful anyway.
- The back-button at the map has been removed (use F3 instead).
- The back-button in the hangar has been removed (use ESC-q instead).
- The 'default loadout' button at the loadout screen has been moved to the
  lower right to lower the chance of clicking it by accident.
- The version number of the modification is shown in the lower right corner of
  the map.
- The 'dialogs='-part of dialog.mdl has been extensively commented and
  refactored (no effect on gameplay)


Installation:
-------------
1. Shut down Allegiance.
2. Run the installer. :)
3. Launch Allegiance.


Uninstallation:
-------------
1. Shut down Allegiance.
2. Run the uninstaller (from Control Panel -> Add or Remove Programs). :)
3. Launch Allegiance.


Additional remarks:
-------------------
- Designed for the normal UI and Slipstream GUI. Please note that this
  installer still uses Slipstream v0.1 for all CortUI-modified graphics.
  Please speak up if you want to do the necessary modifications.
- Slipstream GUI should be installed *only with this installer* if you want
  to use CortUI. If you want to CortUI *and* Slipstream GUI you have to
  install them in the same installation session. You can not for example
  install Slipstream, then run the installer again and install CortUI (in this
  case, just select Slipstream again during the second installation!). This
  also applies if you have already installed Slipstream: select Slipstream
  again during installation.
- Designed for 800x600 and 1024x768. 640x480 is *not* supported! Higher
  resolutions haven't been tested but are reported to work fine. The modified
  software HUDs ('Raveen-style' and 'Parci-style') require 1024x768 or above!
- lessHUD was designed for 800x600 or higher.
- JelloShot was designed for 1280x1024.  The minimum resolution is 1024x768.
  Lower resolutions will result in the HUD being covered by chat, inventory,
  and map panes.
- To change the settings you made during installation, you have two options:
  Either edit cortui_settings.mdl yourself or just run the installation again.
  This will not harm the uninstallation process at all.
- If you don't like the position of the 'default loadout' button on the loadout
  screen: open loadoutpane.mdl, search for a line that defines
  'defaultBtnPosition' and change the second value from 318 back to 158


Known problems:
---------------
- The CortUI-hangar screen modification can't be used with the Slipstream
  v0.2 modified hangar until somebody edits the graphics.
- The chat in the loadout screen can't be scrolled with PageUp/PageDown.
  Pressing these buttons anyway will only scroll the chat display of the
  other screens.
- Don't press F4 at the map, the inventory is shown anyway at all times.
- After pressing F3, the 'last hovered over' information of the minimap is
  lost.
- The non-expanded mode of F6 overlaps with the chat. :( Does anybody use
  this mode often?
- After you died, in the one or two seconds until you return to the station,
  you still see some UI elements that shouldn't be there. :(
- Sometimes, you see the autopilot indicator without having a target. This
  is mainly an Allegiance bug, not a CortUI bug.
- The minimap can no longer be hidden (it can't be toggled at all). (Don't
  press F7. If you accidently do, press it again.)

To Do:
------

  the Slipstream 0.2 style. Please volunteer if you can do that. (Can be done
  with any raster-image editor.)
