Known problems:
---------------
- The chat in the loadout screen can't be scrolled with PageUp/PageDown.
  Pressing these buttons anyway will only scroll the chat display on the
  other screens.
- Don't press F4 on the map, the inventory is shown anyway at all times.
- After pressing F3, the 'last hovered over' information of the minimap is
  lost.
- After you died, in the one or two seconds until you return to the station,
  you still see some UI elements that shouldn't be there. :(
- Sometimes, you see the autopilot indicator without having a target. This
  is mainly an Allegiance bug, not a CortUI bug.
- The minimap can no longer be hidden (it can't be toggled at all). (Don't
  press F7. If you accidently do, press it again.)
- The uninstaller doesn't delete the /artwork/mods/CortUI directory, even if
  it is empty.
