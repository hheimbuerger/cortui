\*****************************************************************************/


This is a modification of the user interface of Allegiance
(http://www.freeallegiance.org/). It is based on and inspired by Ksero's
modification
(http://www.freeallegiance.org/modules.php?name=Forums&file=viewtopic&t=11664).


Changes in CortUI (compared to default UI):
-------------------------------------------
- Chat has ten lines instead of five.
- Base status display in hangar-mode has been moved from the top to the bottom
  right, to not overlap with the chat.
- Parts of the hangar graphics have been removed to not overlap with the chat.
- Help button in hangar-mode has been removed because it overlapped with the
  chat and isn't helpful anyway.
- Autopilot and vector-lock status in flight-mode have been moved and the
  graphics have been made smaller to not overlap with the chat.
- Map-mode shows all necessary ship status info in upper left area of the
  screen. (Autopilot and vector-lock status, name of current target, distance
  to current target, ship type, shield status, hull status, energy status,
  ammo status, fuel status, current thrust, current speed, current signature,
  kill bonus.)
- Ripcord time is now displayed in map-mode as well, not only in flight-mode.


Installation:
-------------
1. Shut down Allegiance.
2. Create a backup of the following files in your \artwork directory:
   - dialog.mdl
   - hangar.mdl
   This package contains a \backup directory that contains the unmodified
   files. Nevertheless, you shouldn't trust it but rather do your own backup.
3. Extract the files in this archive to your \artwork directory, overwriting
   the existing files.
4. Launch Allegiance.


Additional remarks:
-------------------
- Designed for the normal UI and Slipstream GUI. When you want to use it with
  Slipstream, you should use the special package for this. Otherwise, the
  command bar in the map mode will have the standard design.
- Designed for 800x600 and 1024x768.
- Works with normal HUD and software HUD. (Although I don't recommend using
  this UI with software HUD at 800x600, because I had to move down the status
  bar to make room for the ten chat lines, so its pretty much in the center
  at 800x600 now.)
- The four red lines of command wing info don't overlap with the chat lines,
  but they do overlap with the hud and the info in map-mode. :( Suggestions
  to solve this problem are appreciated, I don't see any proper solution
  currently. I can move them, modify their font, etc. But I just don't know
  where to.
- The chat lines overlap with the normal display in the loadout-screen. I
  can't think of a proper solution either.


Package contents:
-----------------
- dialog.mdl (replaces existing file): Contains all changes of in-game GUI.
- hangar.mdl (replaces existing file): Contains all changes of hangar GUI.
- cortui_animinvestbmp.mdl: Contains the animation that highlights the
  investment button when you hover with your mouse cursor over it. Some pixels
  at the top of this graphic were made black to not overlay the chat.
- cortui_conautopilotbmp.mdl: Contains the autopilot-icon. The icon was resized
  to take less space on the screen in in-flight- and map-mode.
- cortui_convectorlockbmp.mdl: Contains the autopilot-icon. The icon was
  resized to take less space on the screen in in-flight- and map-mode.
- cortui_concommdisplaybmp.mdl: I'm not completely sure about this one. It
  seems to be the graphic (completely black) that is used as the background of
  the chat display. I had to increase its size to display all ten lines of
  chat.
- cortui_hangarbmp.mdl: Contains the background image of the hangar. Some
  pixels at the top of this graphic were made black to not overlay the chat.
- backup\dialog.mdl: the original dialog.mdl from the installer 1.26
- backup\hangar.mdl: the original hangar.mdl from the installer 1.26
- backup\dialog.mdl.Ksero: Ksero's modification of the dialog.mdl


Version history:
----------------
1.2:
  * added support for software HUD

1.1:
  + added current ship name and KB to map-mode
  * moved base status display down and to the right
  * moved the chat four pixels down

1.0:
  + 10 chat-lines
  + hangar-view modified
  + AP- and VL-icons modified and moved
  + ship status and ripcord time added to map-mode 


To Do:
------
- The base status display image should be modified so that it fits better to
  the background of its new position. This can be done with any pixel graphic
  editor (Paint, PSP, Photoshop) and a bit of talent. I'm missing the latter,
  so please contact me if you want to do that. You'll be mentioned in the
  release notes as a matter of fact.
- Test for compatibility with Slipstream GUI.

Constructive criticism and feature requests are appreciated. This modification
is free for use. :D The files may be modified without further notification of
the author. Would be nice if you mention me in the release notes of
modifications that are based on this one. :)


Acknowledgements:
-----------------
This modification would not have been possible without Ksero's modification,
his excellent documentation of the .mdl-files, and his support!
Thanks to Radikal for the first (and only :D) beta test.
